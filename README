These are the codes I have created as part of the ENIGMA project. Executing any without command line arguments will give a description of how to properly execute.

Examples of what you can do with these codes can be found in the shell scripts directory.

Installation:
1) Install xrate: http://biowiki.org/XrateSoftware#Getting_xrate
2) Add the xrate binary to the path
3) Install eval: http://mblab.wustl.edu/software.html
4) Add the eval .pm, .pl files to the path
5) In the ENIGMA directory type "make" or "make all" to compile the codes
6) Add an environment variable: $ENIGMADIR = path to ENIGMA directory
